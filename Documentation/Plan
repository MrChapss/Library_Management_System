Library Management System (OOP PROJECT)

FLOW OF THE SYSTEM:
1. Start with login (switch statement)
>> 1st option is STUDENT (fresh account when running the java, but saved when looping and reverse)
>> 2nd option is librarian/ADMIN (pre-saved account already in the code)

2. if STUDENT { (switch statement)
    1. Input his/her ID
    2. The system will verify if its true
    3. The STUDENT will access the main menu for STUDENT only:
        3.1 Check Books (Books availability)
        3.2 Book mark (adding a book to be read or something like that)
        3.3 Remove a book mark
        3.4 Exit (exiting the application)

}

2. if LIBRARIAN/ADMIN { (switch statement)
    1. Input his/her ID
    2. The system will verify if its true
    3. The LIBRARIAN will access the ADMIN menu which have the following:
        3.1 Check User (How many user and name?)
        3.2 Check Books (Books availability)
        3.3 Add Book
        3.4 Remove Book
        3.5 Exit
}

Structure of Code:
1. 4 classes (probably):
    1. Main
    2. Member
    3. Librarian
    4. Book

2. Encapsulate the member, librarian, book

3. Polymorphism the book class (so many books can be created in 1 book)

4. Abstract the process (looping or something to be called as process)

5. Try to inheritance the member and librarian
