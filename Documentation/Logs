What I have learn during creating the project:

1. I learn to seperate the input and output from classes
2. Learning how to use the try catch
3. Leaning my mistake in inheritance where Idk how to do it and how to utilize it

11/16/25
1. I learn how to the parseInt
2. I learn how to properly use the inheritance for Admin and Students
3. I learn to declare the variable as (private) static in method to make the logic work properly.

11/19/25
1. I continue to work my project and add small progress
2. I added switch case to account login

11/20/25
1. Added a measure when user will input empty spaces or blank inputs in the name
2. I use polymorphism when checking the account user and id of student/admin (i extract the content of "validator" class
   then paste it on super class "user" to perform polymorphism to admin and student)
3. I utilize the super class "user" to make it more flexible to its child class
   (I only kept the getter in student and admin to let their classes hold the value of input/scanner)
   
11/23/25
1. I learn how to use nested switch and how important break is

11/24/25
1. From now then on I will use switch lambda for stability of the code (prone to error when standard switch)
2. I can loop it with back option but the code is messy at the moment

11/27/25
1. Naiisip ko sa book class, gagamit ng arraylist para gumawa ng name of book tapos yung magiging id nya
	yung index niya mismo (gagamit nalang ng .equalsIgnoreCase para maiwasan yung duplication)
2. Bug or bold sa 113 at 108 (pwede rin bug sa mismong logic ng book class)

11/30/25
1. I gotta lock in blud, tangina mo sayang araw natin
2. Be better everyday

11/30/25 (3:55pm)
1. fresh start again and again to better

12/15/25 (3:57pm)
1. fresh start tapos nag ask kay AI how to improve my code
2. Kinopya at inaaral ko yung code ni ChatGPT kung paano nag work yung login nya para magawa ko rin
3. Mag add ako ng max retries sa login without use of chatgpt para maintindihan ko

12/16/25 (3:43pm)
1. Gagawa ako ng max retries sa login para standard (done)
2. lalagyan ko siya ng try catch para less sa error (done)
3. Added how many left retries they can log in if wrong inputs (done)
4. Nag merge ako ng branch, maangas siya at slightly gets lang

12/17/25 (1:59pm)
1. Encounter a bug where count of retries are showing even correct input details (bug solved)
2. Same case when the max limit of retries reached (solved)
3. I try catch the line 18 so it won't crash the program
4. Added how the menu work and inputs
