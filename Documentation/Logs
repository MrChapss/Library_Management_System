What I have learn/done during creating the project:

1. I learn to seperate the input and output from classes
2. Learning how to use the try catch
3. Leaning my mistake in inheritance where Idk how to do it and how to utilize it

11/16/25
1. I learn how to the parseInt
2. I learn how to properly use the inheritance for Admin and Students
3. I learn to declare the variable as (private) static in method to make the logic work properly.

11/19/25
1. I continue to work my project and add small progress
2. I added switch case to account login

11/20/25
1. Added a measure when user will input empty spaces or blank inputs in the name
2. I use polymorphism when checking the account user and id of student/admin (i extract the content of "validator" class
   then paste it on super class "user" to perform polymorphism to admin and student)
3. I utilize the super class "user" to make it more flexible to its child class
   (I only kept the getter in student and admin to let their classes hold the value of input/scanner)
   
11/23/25
1. I learn how to use nested switch and how important break is

11/24/25
1. From now then on I will use switch lambda for stability of the code (prone to error when standard switch)
2. I can loop it with back option but the code is messy at the moment

11/27/25
1. Naiisip ko sa book class, gagamit ng arraylist para gumawa ng name of book tapos yung magiging id nya
	yung index niya mismo (gagamit nalang ng .equalsIgnoreCase para maiwasan yung duplication)
2. Bug or bold sa 113 at 108 (pwede rin bug sa mismong logic ng book class)

11/30/25
1. I gotta lock in blud, tangina mo sayang araw natin
2. Be better everyday

11/30/25 (3:55pm)
1. fresh start again and again to better

12/15/25 (3:57pm)
1. fresh start tapos nag ask kay AI how to improve my code
2. Kinopya at inaaral ko yung code ni ChatGPT kung paano nag work yung login nya para magawa ko rin
3. Mag add ako ng max retries sa login without use of chatgpt para maintindihan ko

12/16/25 (3:43pm)
1. Gagawa ako ng max retries sa login para standard (done)
2. lalagyan ko siya ng try catch para less sa error (done)
3. Added how many left retries they can log in if wrong inputs (done)
4. Nag merge ako ng branch, maangas siya at slightly gets lang

12/17/25 (1:59pm)
1. Encounter a bug where count of retries are showing even correct input details (bug solved)
2. Same case when the max limit of retries reached (solved)
3. I try catch the line 18 so it won't crash the program
4. Added a comment on how the menu work and inputs

12/17/25 (11:37pm)
1. I create add function to menu but still messy code (it must be switch statement to make it clean)
2. the code inside of Book class is experiment

12/18/25 (2:43pm)
1. I encounter the problem on how do I make it CRUD if different switch statement for admin and student
2. How do I make a back button after they finished doing that function (adding book or removing)
3. MAIN PROBLEM: paano ko siya ma-loop yung menu until sinabi ininput ni user

12/18/25 (9:02pm)
1. I solved the main problem today but I lack ideas how to properly stop it (the program itself)
2. the code I wrote today might be redundant but it works intended and more bugs haha

12/19/25 (3:53pm)
1. I'm fixing the menu infinite loop
2. There's a new bug on login where:
	2.1 If user input 123M on id then put its username it success login (scary bug)
	PROPOSE SOLUTION: change the id to password (done)

NEW BUGS - 12/19/25 (4:09pm)
1. Dapat may condition yung login na mag end agad yung program if max retries na si user

FIXED BUGS - 12/19/25 (5:29pm)
1. the menu infinite loop
2. the user will not proceed to menu if login maximum retires reached

GOALS - 12/19/25 (5:31pm)
1. Understand the code and apply DRY method (TOP PRIORITY)
2. Implement database

12/20/25 (2:56pm)
1. I added comments throughout project or proper documentation
2. Understanding the suggested improvements
3. Added precaution if admin input nothing or spaces when adding book
4. Not productive today (puro plano lang kung ano next gagawin)

GOALS - 12/20/25(3:19pm)
1. add database
2. use hashmap
3. use enums 
4. Change the method or polymorph the menu into right function
 like student returning a book not just adding a new book
 
12/22/25 (3:32pm)
1. Added a precaution if user add a book similar name it will throw a "the book is already added!" 
2. Added a precaution if user delete a book even its not existing, it will throw "the book does not exist"
3. Added a feedback if user successfully deleted or added a book.

12/23/25 (11:15pm)
1. I'm gonna add database and connect it on LMS java project in eclipse
2. it was connection only I created during that time
3. pangit tlga mag code sa gabi kasi antok at dpat mag code sa umaga para maayos

12/24/25 (2:45pm)
1. I re-create how to create connection java to database (mysql)
2. gonna create DAO class sabi ni chatgpt
3. I'm gonna learn the mysql and connection of java on scratch

12/24/25 (6:20pm)
1. I learn how to create table using the sql on myphpadmin
2. I must memorize the pattern of the url so it won't prone to error (wrong spelling led to error)
3. I will practice more and implement what I learned in my LMS project

12/26/25 (11:46pm)
1. I forgot to write this earlier since I was focus creating dao method for LMS
2. I integrated some of my testing or learnings to my project especially to login and sign up
3. I use and download the BCrypt to hash the password to protect it
4. I also used PrepapredStatement for anti sql injection
5. I also learned how to the system will check the hashed password if its the password of the user
6. I will aim to improve and discover rather than perfection (you can keep messy codes for now but change it later)

01/01/26 (4:44pm)
1. NEW BUG - where user can create account with username but no password or no username no password but created
2. NEW BUG - the exception words are showing in the error that can be used lack of security
 			 (it must show only the words or anything but execption error)
3. I fixed the bug where empty input can register by adding if statement then return false it if empty input
4. I asked chatgpt how to fix the error in catch exception handling and it was fixed afterward
5. I used the try-with-resources to close the resources similar to switch expression to reduce boilerplate
6. NEW BUG - If user type only existing username then input empty password it the system will tell hint to attacker 
			 such as "username or password cannot be empty + account is already exist" at the same time.

01/02/26 (12:11pm)
1. I fixed the #6 BUG yesterday by using continue statement which used for skipping values

01/02/26 (8:39pm)
2. I will learn the basics of spring boot on another project
   (Maybe I will push it on github)

   
01/02/26 (10:15pm)
3. I launch the spring boot or should say I run the spring to my eclipse IDE and knowing how it works on browser
4. From I what learned today, spring boot helps us reduce the boilerplate and today I use the spring web to see the connection of java to web

01/03/26 (1:33pm)
1. I create controller class then import get mapping, request mapping, and rest controller
2. The purpose of request mapping is become the based url for all get mapping url (based on my understanding)
3. I experiment changing the url based on user interaction 
4. I learn to add and use parameter such as name in URL

01/04/26 (11:01pm)
1. I learn how to use the @PathVariable to make dynamic path using the URL
