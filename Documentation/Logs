1. I learn how to the parseInt
2. I learn how to properly use the inheritance for Admin and Students
3. I learn to declare the variable as (private) static in method to make the logic work properly.

1. I continue to work my project and add small progress
2. I added switch case to account login

11/20/25
1. Added a measure when user will input empty spaces or blank inputs in the name
2. I use polymorphism when checking the account user and id of student/admin (i extract the content of "validator" class
   then paste it on super class "user" to perform polymorphism to admin and student)
3. I utilize the super class "user" to make it more flexible to its child class
   (I only kept the getter in student and admin to let their classes hold the value of input/scanner)
